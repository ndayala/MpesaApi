PesaPI

PesaPI is an unofficial open source API for mobile money systems, released under the BSD(lite) license.
The system currently support:

    Kenya: Mpesa paybill accounts
    Kenya: Mpesa private accounts
    Kenya: Yu private accounts (experimental)
    Ghana: Airtel private accounts (experimental)
    Rwanda: MNT private accounts (experimental)

The API supports both PUSH and PULL versions. The PHP version of the API is generally the most mature and recomended at this point - the system is build using Mysql and Curl. Please direct all questions to the public mailing-list "pesaPi" on Google-groups: http://groups.google.com/group/pesapi

Current status

The current system should be considered as beta version - at least one commercial solution is using it as its payment gateway. However it is not recomended that you deploy the system without having a developer available to support the setup.

Version 0.1.0 was recently released and is contains a major rework of the internal structures of PesaPi - be alert that things that worked previously may not be fully working yet - as detailed testing is ongoing.

Currently we are looking for people to provide copies of the SMS messages they are getting from various payment systems.
System design overview

    Supports both push and pull notifications.
    Does synchroization between local and server database.
    Transaction data are available even when main server is down.
    Super easy to utilize for integrators.
    Fast response on historical data.
    Keep the load on servers as low as possible.
    Hopefully more reliable than other APIs.

API Overview

The PesaPi class contains several static methods, these methods are the main interface.

    availableBalance(time) -- returns the balance at a given point in time
    locateByReceipt(receipt) -- returns a payment or null for the given receipt number
    locateByPhone(phone, from, until) -- returns an array of payments from a particular phone
    locateByName(name, from, until) -- returns an array of payments from a particular client name
    locateByAccount(account, from, until) -- returns an array of payments from a particular account-no
    locateByTimeInterval(from, until) -- returns an array of all payments within a given time interval

As an alternative you can ask PesaPi to call a your on your site when a new transaction is received (push mechanics).
Way forward

The following is a highlevel "todo" list for the project

    Getting the code to release/production quality.
    Getting more developers onboard.
    Add support for more payment systems.
